# File Metadata Extractor :mag_right:

This Python script recursively scans a specified directory, extracting metadata from `.mp4` files and saving the information to a CSV file. It's designed to help users discover and organize their media files more efficiently.

## Features :sparkles:

- Recursively scan directories
- Filter and process only `.mp4` files
- Extract file name, size, creation, and modification dates
- Save metadata to a CSV file

## Usage :computer:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Modify `metaextractor.py`, replacing `'path/to/your/folder'` with your target directory.
3. Run the script using `python metaextractor.py`.
4. Check `file_metadata.txt` for the output.
